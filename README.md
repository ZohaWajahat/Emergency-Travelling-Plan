# Description

A traveler is visiting different places and suddenly receives a call from the office to reach back office due to an emergency meeting. Now the traveler is required to move back as soon as possible but he has certain constraints. There are some cities that are connected through road networks, and some are also connected through air connections. The traveler may not stop in a city where there is an aerial route taking him back to previous visited cities. As he is in far remote areas and the roads are not that good so he can travel to a maximum of 6 cities in one day if he travels by road. Once he reaches the city having the aerial route, he reaches the other destination of the aerial route by the end of the same day. <br/>
